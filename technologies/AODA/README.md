## Why is Web Accessibility Important?

The Internet is perhaps the greatest inventions since the wheel. Think about what you use the Internet for in your daily life. Do you use it for work and leisure, for communication, shopping, government licenses and forms, or for education? Our lives revolve around the Internet and the services it provides, however, much of the Internet is inaccessible to people with disabilities.

Over 16% of Ontarians have a disability and that is expected to rise over the coming years as the population ages. By 2036, 47% of Ontario’s population is expected to be over 65 years of age. These are figures CSAE members cannot ignore! Everyone knows someone with a disability and that is why accessibility is so important to Ontario’s future. Accessibility affects multiple lives. It affects everyone.
