# Differences

https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-vs-angular/

- React is used far more at Facebook than Angular is at Google
- Google AdWords, one of the most important projects at Google, uses Angular
- Angular is considered a framework because it offers strong opinions as to how your application should be structured
- Angular also has much more functionality “out-of-the-box”
- React is more flexible. It only provides the “view” in MVC – you need to solve the M and C on your own
- Angular has better CLI?
- React does not provide dependency injection and uses FETCH for Ajax requests.
- React uses Virtual DOM and Angular uses (Regular DOM!!) Zone library with Change Detection
- React uses `One-Way` data binding whereas Angular uses `Two-Way` data binding
- Advantage of TypeScript is that it offers more consistency in examples found online (React examples can be found in either ES5 or ES6)
- When creating mobile app, Angular uses `Ionic` framework, the resulting app on a device is simply a web app inside of a native web view container. Because of this, the apps can be slow and laggy. `React Native`, on the other hand, is a platform developed by Facebook for creating truly native
- Unlike Ionic, which is simply a glorified web app, React Native produces a truly native UI
- React uses JEST while Angular uses KARMA
- Angular : Module + Component based architecture, React: Component based architecture
- Angular has lazy loading.
